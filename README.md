Drive Vault Sync README

This plugin will pull your Goodnotes journals synced to Google drive, and export them to obsidian as individual images to be linked to notes.


* IMPORTANT: *

PLUGIN WONT WORK UNLESS CONFIGURED IN SETTINGS

Set goodnotes to sync to google drive as [PDF] or as [Goodnotes and PDF], and take note of the destination folder name in order to configure in the plugin settings.

MAKE SURE to configure the google drive folder that the plugin will pull from in the plugin settings!

If you are having issues with deleted notes being synced, it's a google drive end issue, and can be resolved by deleting old notes from there.
